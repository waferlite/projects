# Fashion_MNIST

A convolutional neural network solution to a Computer Vision problem of classifying 10 different fashion garments.

This is my first implementation of a network. I have used a 3 layered CNN with maxpooling, batch normalisation and Xavier weights.

Dataset sourced from https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.git and modifiied according to requirement.

Network created using 60000 training examples, and is tested on 10000 examples. Final accuracy obtained was around 90.6%

Program completely coded using Python, as well as Pytorch and Scikitlearn.

Due to the constraints of Github, two files (fashion-mnist_train and train-images-idx3-ubyte) could not be uploaded - they can be found at https://zalando-research/fashionmnist/data. Once downloaded, they should be placed in the same directory as the rest of the files.
